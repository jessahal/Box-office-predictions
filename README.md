# Box-office-predictions

Stat 486 Final project, Box office predictions based on the TMDb API data and "The Numbers" movie budget and revenue data.
### Question of Interest
Can we predict the box office earnings for a movie based on the metadata (genre, budget, main cast, release date, producer, etc) and the critic reviews?
